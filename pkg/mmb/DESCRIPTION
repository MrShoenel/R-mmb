Title: Arbitrary Dependency Mixed Multivariate Bayesian Models for Inferencing, Regression,
    and Neighborhood Search using Joint Probabilities and Kernel Density Estimation
Version: 0.7.0
Author: Sebastian Hönel
Maintainer: Sebastian Hönel <sebastian.honel@lnu.se>
Description: This package supports Bayesian models with full and partial (hence arbitrary)
    dependencies between variables. Discrete and continuous variables are supported,
    and conditional joint probabilities and probability densities are estimated
    using Kernel Density Estimation. The full general form, which implements an
    extension to Bayes' theorem, as well as the simple form, which is just a
    Bayesian network, both support regression through segmentation and KDE and estimation
    of probability or relative likelihood of discrete or continuous target random variables.

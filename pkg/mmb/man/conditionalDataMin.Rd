\title{Given a dataframe and a list of features (and their values), this
function returns a subset of the rows where each feature's value
is equal to (discrete feature) or less-than-or-equal (numeric feature).
Only rows fulfilling all conditions are returned. Then this data can
be used to estimate kernel densities given the remaining data or to
compute frequencies (for discrete features).}
\usage{
conditionalDataMin(df, features, selectedFeatureNames = c(),
  retainMinValues = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame with data to segment. If it contains less than or
equally many rows as specified by \code{retainMinValues}, then the same
data.frame is returned.}

\item{features}{a data.frame from @seealso \code{sampleToBayesFeatures}}

\item{selectedFeatureNames}{a string vector to select the features that
the conditions will rely on. If empty, then the unconditied (i.e., original)
dataframe will be returned.}

\item{retainMinValues}{default 1. The minimum amount of rows to retain.
Filtering the data by the selected features may reduce the amount of
remaining rows quickly, and this can be used as an early stopping criteria.
Note that filtering is done variable by variable, and the amount of
remaining rows is evaluated after each segmenting-step. If the threshold
is undercut, then the result from the previous round is returned.}

\item{features}{data.frame of bayes-features that are used to segment.
Each feature's value is used to segment the data, and the features are
used in the order as given by \code{selectedFeatureNames}. If those are
not given, then the order of this data.frame is used.}

\item{selectedFeatureNames}{default \code{c()}. Character vector with the
names of the variables that shall be used for segmenting. Segmenting is
done variable by variable, and the order depends on this vector. If this
vector is empty, then the originally given data.frame is returned.}
}
\value{
a data.frame with those rows meeting all conditions
Takes a data.frame and segments it, according to the selected variables.
Only rows satisfying all conditions are kept. Supports discrete and con-
tinuous variables.
